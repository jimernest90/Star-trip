### Struggles and Wins

Acquiring the third party API was very difficult. I was able to access it with the Object keys. I was also able to do a delete funtion as well. This was very challenging.

I used React.js to make this site. I also used React Router for the naviagation. I also used css for the styling. Checkout the site for yourself <a href='http://trip-to-stars.surge.sh/'> here</a>
